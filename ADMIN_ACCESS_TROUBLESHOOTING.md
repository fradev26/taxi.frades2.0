# 🔧 Admin Dashboard Access Troubleshooting

## Why can't I see the admin dashboard differences?

The most likely reason is that you're not logged in as an admin user. Here's how to fix this:

## 🚀 Quick Solution

### Step 1: Create an Admin Account
1. Go to http://localhost:8081/login
2. Click on "Registreren" (Sign Up)
3. Use one of these email addresses for admin access:
   - `admin@test.com` (password: whatever you want)
   - `test@admin.com` (password: whatever you want)
   - Or any email ending with `@frades.be`

### Step 2: Access Admin Panel
1. After signing up and logging in, go to: http://localhost:8081/admin
2. You should now see the complete admin dashboard with all new features

## 🎯 What You Should See

### Enhanced Pricing Tab
When you click on "Prijzen" in the admin dashboard, you should see **three sub-tabs**:
1. **Algemeen** - General pricing settings
2. **Per Voertuig** - Vehicle-specific pricing 
3. **Prijsformules** - Price formula management (NEW!)

### Booking Form Auto-Fill
On the main booking page (http://localhost:8081), you should see new buttons:
- **"Huidige locatie"** next to the pickup field
- **"Vandaag"** next to the date field  
- **"Nu"** next to the time field

### Business Tax Profile
If you sign up as a business user:
1. Go to http://localhost:8081/account
2. You should see a "Volledig profiel" button in the business section
3. This takes you to: http://localhost:8081/belasting-profiel-zakelijk

## 🔍 Debug Information

When you try to access the admin panel, check the browser console (F12) for debug logs that show:
- Your current user email
- Admin status (true/false)
- Whether you're logged in

## 🛠️ Alternative: Temporarily Lower Admin Requirements

If you want to test with any email, I can temporarily modify the admin check to allow any logged-in user. Let me know if you need this!

## 📝 Current Admin Emails That Work:
- Anything ending with `@frades.be`
- `admin@test.com`
- `test@admin.com`

## 🚨 Common Issues:

1. **Not logged in** → Go to /login and create an account
2. **Wrong email domain** → Use one of the admin emails above
3. **Cache issues** → Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or clear browser cache
4. **Database not running** → Check if Supabase is running with `npx supabase status`

Try these steps and let me know what you see! The features are definitely implemented and working.
